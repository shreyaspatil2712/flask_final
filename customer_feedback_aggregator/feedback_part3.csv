Alex was extremely helpful and always available if we had any questions or concerns. He kept in constant contact with us and told us exactly what was going to be happening and when.

The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly.  But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster.

I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website.  Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries.

For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled.  However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited.

NASB sent me a ""credit counseling letter"" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services.  When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current.

Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department.  

The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me.  The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything.

After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service.  I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran... Read More

Our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed.

We had no idea where we were in the process unless I contacted Steve. Poor, poor communication. Mr. Kang also was ""sure"" our house would appraise for $30k more than our house did, talking us into a loan that we didn't end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only .4% lower than our current mortgage.

This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now ""too old."" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star... Read More

I never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation... Read More

It all started when Bob G ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. When I agreed to use NASB, Bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them.

What a horrible experience. We have excellent credit, plenty of income, etc. NASB rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up, but then just a few weeks before the closing, she just disappeared, and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date! Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end. Not sure to this day why she didn't want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another. I'm sure there are good lenders here, but this is not one of them...

Rep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. At the end of round one, his rates and fees were VERY competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch... Read More

I was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning. I expected honest communication from a loan consultant from NASB bank and I did not receive that. I am very disappointed... Read More

The Interest rate offered and time to close being short sold us on the loan so we pursued it despite -
1. the fact that a credit check and underwriting was made when per VA rules for an IRRRL these were not necessary and we were assured by Mr. Owens when first discussing the refinancing they would not be made. 
2. the constant errors in the paperwork. One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds. Another was not classifying the currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in December just a month later during the time NASB intended to sell the mortgage. Thankfully this was corrected by the Closing Agent.
3. Mr. Owens not being straight with us about NASB's intent to sell the mortgage after closing. His statements of first saying NASB would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the Loan Estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there ""just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future."" Since today, just 5 days after disbursement, I find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows Mr. Owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn't definite. 
4. taking 4 calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial Closing Document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until 15 minutes prior to arrival at the Closing Agent's place of business.
Pros allow for the Neutral instead of bad rating because the ""despites"" show that the customer support during this loan process was extremely poor and unacceptable.

Good News:

The $995 processing fee was waived.
The rate was locked for 35 days but they closed in 9 weeks, I did not have to pay for an extension.
They have also floated my rate down 1/8 percent without any fees.
Until the closing I did not pay anything other than a credit history check fee.

Not so good news:

This was a very long and frustrating experience.
I do believe that the process took longer than expected mostly because of the busy refinance season.
I might be a difficult customer or may be just unlucky but there was always a problem with every stage and detail of my refinance experience.
I am trying not to blame the ""loan consultant"" (BYRON HOUSWORTH) for this.

Whenever I asked about any time line, the answer was fixed ""in a week or so"". I had to wait for 9 (nine) weeks to close.

It was my luck that his vacation week was in the middle of my process.

If NASB needs a document they will wait until the last minute and then come back ""oh we need this document or else we can't continue""
When you have that one taken care of, they will wait ""a week or so"" to get back to you and next week you will hear ""it turns out we also need this document""
This went on and on, the day before the closing they would email me and say ""we just noticed that we didn't have your employment verification done"", hours before closing,
""oh we just found out that we don't have your home insurance verification and we can't reach them""
I called the insurance company and in ten minutes it was taken care of.

I don't know how many times I had to hear ""this should be OK"" and turns out it is not OK.

Many many times they assured me they have all the information they need - but this was never the case.

They were not very careful, they missed out all the details, they wasted weeks and weeks because they were not able to go through a check list and see if they have taken care of everything.

They always say ""we are too busy with a lot of applications"". I believe they shouln't accept applications that they can't process.

Sample communication:

me: Why am I being charged for such and such?
respond: We are not charging you for that.
me: Please check the final HUD line XX
respond: Sorry I didn't go down that far.
me: ???

Some of my favorite quotes from them:
""Sorry! Don't come across this too often. ""
""Wasn't aware of that...""
""This should work.""
""Can you possibly call them again? We need it ASAP.""
""Thank you for your patience.""
""TGIF!"" --(I had to hear this 8-9 times)

They are not bad people, but you need a lot of patience dealing with them.

Do I suggest working with them?
Only if you are not under any time pressure.
Only if you can work hard for your own application.
Only if you have a lot of patience.

This closing went pretty smooth with the exception of a few bumps. The customer service agent was prompt with responses as well as document transfers. I was not keen on doing a refinance all electronic through email and phone, but I have to say, the process was easy and went well. I got a great rate and the closing costs were good.

The only issue I had was at closing, the final documents were written for a 30 year loan and it was suppose to be a 25 year loan, An issue happened at the final writing so I did not close on the specified closing date, it happened a day later after the papers were rewritten. It was great they were able to resolve it in one day, the bad part was I got charged a rate lock extension fee as my rate lock expired on the day I was suppose to close. I am sure I could have fought them on the fee as it was caused because of their mistake but now I was closing on New years eave and did not want to carry the closing over to the new year...

Thats how simple and quick they were with my loan; I was actually able to enjoy the entire process from application to closing.   Their response time to emails was unbelievable; you would have a response within minutes at almost all hours of the day.

I had a good gut feeling about Triumph Lending, but I wasted a lot of time checking with a few other mortgage companies.

Those other companies were all over the map. There were two I never heard back from after the pre-approval stage. One of them completely ignored one an email I sent as a follow up to a phone call. Another waited a month to call me back. Two of them promised information and ever provided it.

The real prize winner was particularly pushy and was completely unprofessional when I informed him I had decided to use Triumph lending because they're closing costs were thousands of dollars lower.

But everyone I worked with at Triumph, mostly Vanessa Flores (Loan Officer) & Alina Vargas (Loan Processor), took every question seriously, never failed to respond to a request (quickly and accurately), and I know it sounds cliche, but I felt like I was more than just a number to them.

It was a pleasure with John. Besides all the fees and closing costs being lower than other brokers that I reached out to, John was involved in every step of the way. He was on top of every element of the transaction and communicated timely, nothing was left to chance and even the loan was ready to be funded one week prior to closing day!
Having shopped around and compared other brokers, I know I made a great decision (financially and for peace of mind) going with John. I would not hesitate to recommend his services to anyone looking for a home loan... Read More

I started a process for a mortgage loan with Triumph Lending (Network Funding) in Houston, TX. I was given a pre-approval quickly with a great Interest Rate. I was continually informed via email and phone calls thorough the entire process of the loan. My representative from Triumph Lending (Peter Lammerts) worked tirelessly to make the best deal possible for me in terms of closing costs and interest rate on top of always being available to answer any questions on a loan that, to begin with, looked like it was going to be an easy mortgage loan to process, until some difficulties on my credit report showed up. Peter was very diligent to work on the issues and was able to overcome all of the obstacles in order to do the mortgage closing on time and with my best interest in mind. I highly recommend Peter Lammerts and his team for their professionalism and efficient service.

Buying a home is complicated, there a multiple parties, and competing interests, and it can be a really stressful and frustrating experiecne. What helps enormously is working with a lender that is upfront about what it can offer and accept, in terms of type of loan, type of property, downpayment, and timing of close.  
I received a call from DLJ when my previous lender changed terms on me two weeks into escrow, and in desperation I had filled out the Lending Tree form in the hope if finding a new lender. 
At the time, I honestly thought my purchase was going to fall through. 
The next day I received a call from a number and a lender I didn't recognize. It was DLJ. Am I glad I answered the phone!
Within minutes, Adan Munoz had me back on track. DLJ's team was, across the board, knowledgable, articulate, well-coordinated, calm and constructive. They offered a product that met my needs perfectly, and got me across the finish line in record time.
