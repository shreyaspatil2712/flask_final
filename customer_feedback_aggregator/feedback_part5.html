The email from the mortgage person said that we could initially communicate by email to get the ball rolling if that works, which it does when you spend your entire day on the phone!  So I emailed....and emailed....and emailed....then kept calling, emailed again and even emailed customer service - and NOTHING!  I can't even get the courtesy of a response, even if its to say "got your emails, we will get back to you as soon as we can", which would be perfectly fine.  Now I have a hit on my credit from them and nothing to show for it so now someone else will be getting my business.  Don't waste your time with them... Read More\r\n</td>

He left from another company called Alpine mortgage and moved to this company and thats where everything went bad. Responsiveness towards myself (The agent) and my clients has been slow and every aspect of the transaction has now been delayed. Asking for papers in the 19th hour has killed our chances of closing this on time. Unfortunately Andrew has done everything but help us out and be a strong customer service rep.

      <td>\r\nWhile William was fine, my loan officer, and was at times very good; this entire experience was horrible when it came down to the actual processing and closing. The underwriter did not tell me about additional items needed until the very last week before closing, and I feel that she should have been able to give me that list when I called to check status 2 to 2 1/2 weeks prior. At that point I was told that everything was good to go and just waiting on the appraisal. I live in Hawaii and buying here means that there is a 4 day lag time from when you sign to when the closing is actual. The items she was demanding would take 10-14 business days to get and I had already purchased my airline ticket, shipped my vehicle and household goods. There was no compassion and it came across as she was the word of GOD and I would have to bow her will. The company did not even offer any assistance for having to pay for the changes I had to do with my time and schedule as well as the airfare. They only care when it comes to getting your MONEY! With buying being stressful as it is, this was uncalled for from the companies side and they need to reevaluate their processes and get the understanding of what real customer service is- it is RESPECT of the customer and their time and lives!\r\n\r\nSTAY far away from this company...

My loan mgr Daniel Dunlop stopped working with me because he said he wasn't making enough money from my loan and was pulled off, this was after weeks of not hearing from anyone to find out what was going on with my loan.

      <td>\r\nPositive: Completed mortgage refinance reducing my APR from 5.25% to 3.5%\r\n\r\nHowever: The 3.5% rate was available at several competitors, several of whom offered lower fees. I was also refinancing to reinstate my VA Certificate of Eligibility toward purchase of a home. Since the rate was available elsewhere, I hired GR based on the broker's claim that the transaction could be completed within 4-5 weeks or less. I formally began the process with Guaranteed Rate on July 2. Based on broker feedback that the transaction was in underwriting on July 23rd, we planned the closing date on our new home purchase for 1 month later and I alerted VA. This refinance didn't close with GR until a full month later (Aug 23) and the loan was funded on Aug 27. I came within 2 days of missing a rate-lock date on the other new-home purchase mortgage because of this.\r\n\r\nCommunications from the broker was horrible. As I mentioned, in parallel with this effort, I was going through the process of obtaining a home purchase mortgage from another company, so I have a great basis of comparison. I received no information from Guaranteed Rate without having to ask for it. When I did receive information, it was minimal (typically "yes" or "no" answer), so I had to follow-up with additional questions to get clarification on details (I don't do this for a living, that's why I hired GR! I definitely did NOT receive my money's worth).\r\n\r\nIf I'm to believe the broker, my loan package spent 4 1/2 weeks in underwriting. BTW, my credit scores are all above 770, so there was no issue there. When asked, the broker never offered any rationale for the delay.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by GR, I sent this same review two weeks ago. Surprise - I haven't heard a word back from them apologizing for their complete lack of customer service.\r\n\r\nTrust me, you can do better than these guys... Read More\r\n</td>

I want to make sure I am informed enough to at least have a shot at making an intelligent decision.\r\n\r\nI had asked similar questions of several other lenders who contacted me through this site and they were all very polite and happy to answer my questions. Aaron however, seemed to have an attitude from the moment I picked up the phone and appeared to become more annoyed as I asked more questions.\r\n\r\nHis general tone was one of rudeness and condescension. The conversation ended, when Aaron cut me off in the middle of a question and said "well let me ask you this, what didn't you understand about what I just said?" At that point I informed him that our conversation was over and I would not be doing business with his company.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why Aaron and Guaranteed Rate, Inc. think its acceptable to treat people this way, but if you have expectations similar to mine, you may disappointed with their service.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, they aren't the only game in town.

      <td>\r\nI was "pre-approved" by Guaranteed Rate after they had all of my information, including an extensive application and full access to my credit information. Of course, I stopped dealing with other lenders who had made offers. I then entered into a months-long process of responding to multiple requests for documentation; everything had been clearly spelled out in my application, but they needed corroboration. Whenever I sent something, they would call a few days later and say that "Underwriting" required something else; and that it was all on account of the new govt. regulations. (And note that I was looking to consolidate the 1st and 2d mortgages on my home, and that the total I was asking for was less than 25% of my home's value.)\r\n\r\nFinally, I received a call from my loan contact saying that my credit card balance was too high, and they couldn't give me a loan unless I paid it off first. This was information they had had all along, before they "pre-approved" me. In fact, my primary reason for re-financing was to get my monthly mortgage payments lower and to pay off that credit card balance. I basically said that their response was not acceptable; and we eventually got it done. However, I would never recommend them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would give them high points for is responsiveness. At least until I agreed to go with them, they got back to me quicker than anyone. I didn't go with 2 other lenders who were offering similar rates because they weren't getting back to me as fast as Gauranteed Rate. Once I went with them, however, the process dragged on for months; and they almost weren't going to give me the loan. Buyers Beware... Read More\r\n</td>

After confirming he could offer a much lower rate than my financial institution, he then took the additional time to explain the pros and cons of different loan types (conventional versus VA loans).  Kory also took the time to calculate approximate monthly payments and closing costs for each.  I never felt like I was being pressured or rushed into a decision, in fact I felt quite the opposite.  He gave me whatever time I needed to fully understand my options and make the choice that was right for me, based upon my unique circumstances.  Kory went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable with what has been the biggest financial decision of my life.  Thanks Kory...5 stars... Read More\r\n</td>

When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department.  \r\n\r\nThe woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me.

      <td>\r\nThis loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now "too old." I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had.

      <td>\r\nI never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation...

Not sure to this day why she didn't want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another. I'm sure there are good lenders here, but this is not one of them...

      <td>\r\nRep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying "OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him "thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate." Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying "when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. At the end of round one, his rates and fees were VERY competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch... Read More\r\n</td>

      <td>\r\nI was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning. I expected honest communication from a loan consultant from NASB bank and I did not receive that. I am very disappointed... Read More\r\n</td>
