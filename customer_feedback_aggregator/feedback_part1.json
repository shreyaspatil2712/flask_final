I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website. Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. NASB sent me a \"credit counseling letter\" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department. The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything. After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service.

What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had.

So we had the IRS fax it to them directly, AND STILL they had a problem with it's \"authenticity\". They received everything we had, with no discrepancies, yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and \"dummy up\" a copy, as long as it would match exactly. We said no, the two separate transcripts were accurate, and they could use those, or we would walk. Amazing that a week later they finally approved it. This guy had emailed and called every day, sometimes as many as 4 times, even during our Christmas trip to Dallas, only to sit and wait, and wonder what the black hole was doing. And to make it more annoying, he had a demeaning way of speaking, saying \"Does that make sense?\", after every statement, as if I couldn't understand basic English. One of those things people say when they want people to feel inferior. They requested the 4506T 4 more times, so we sent them at least 8 to make sure.
